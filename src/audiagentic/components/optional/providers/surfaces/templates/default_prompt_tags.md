# Prompt tag doctrine

Rules:

- Parse only the first non-empty line for the workflow tag.
- Keep tag semantics identical to the shared AUDiaGentic launch contract.
- Do not invent provider-specific alternate tags.
- Preserve raw prompt text in provenance metadata.
- Keep provenance visible: provider id, surface, and session id should survive normalization.
